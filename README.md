# pv-spot-prices

Just a small program that helps you to keep track of the latest spot prices on "commodities" in solar energy sector.

The program gets the latest open-source data, checks if the data is relevant, processes it and writes to an .xlsx file. Raw data is also added to a separate sheet just in case.

.xlsx file is generated in your work directory automatically during the first launch. Further launches will rewrite this file.
Online data is updated approximately every week.

Please note, that this small project was written just to get to know Python instruments for Data Science, so the code inside may be not optimal.

All the data is the property of it's owner. Users should respect the legitimate rights for use based on the principle of integrity. This project can not be used for commercial purposes. And any other purposes, unless it helps to make our world a better place. Peace.
